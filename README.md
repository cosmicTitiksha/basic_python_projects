Welcome to my Python playground — a growing collection of real-world Python projects built to sharpen my problem-solving, logic-building, and software development skills.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
> Inspired by a FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

- Developed a terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- Focused on input handling, random generation, and conditional logic
- Solidified understanding of functions, loops, and clean user prompts
- Reinforced the idea of **logic-first coding**



### 🧠 Seat Allotment System
> Designed and coded from scratch to simulate category-based merit seat allotment.
> Inspired by UPTAC counselling system.

- Accepts multiple student inputs with category, marks, and gender
- Sorts candidates by marks using nested list logic
- Allocates open category seats first, then fills reserved seats:
  - OBC Girl
  - OBC
  - SC
  - EWS
- Avoids duplication of selected students
