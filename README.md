# 🐍 basic_python_projects by Titiksha

Welcome to my Python playground — a growing collection of real-world Python projects built to sharpen my problem-solving, logic-building, and software development skills.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
> Inspired by a FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

- Developed a terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game  
- Focused on input handling, random generation, and conditional logic  
- Solidified understanding of functions, loops, and clean user prompts  
- Reinforced the idea of **logic-first coding**

### 🧠 Seat Allotment System
> Designed and coded from scratch to simulate category-based merit seat allotment.  
> Inspired by UPTAC counselling system.

- Accepts multiple student inputs with category, marks, and gender  
- Sorts candidates by marks using nested list logic  
- Allocates open category seats first, then fills reserved seats:
  - OBC Girl
  - OBC
  - SC
  - EWS  
- Avoids duplication of selected students

### 🧮 Calculator App (CLI)
> A simple terminal-based calculator built to explore functions, loops, and user interaction in Python.

- Performs basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Validates division by zero and gives custom feedback  
- Uses `while` loop to support repeated calculations  
- Introduced functions for modular and reusable code  
- Friendly user prompts and error messages

---

### 🔢 Number Guessing Game
> A terminal-based interactive number guessing game using randomness and loop logic.

- Randomly generates a number between 0 and 100  
- Prompts the user to guess until the correct number is entered  
- Gives hints like “Think Higher” or “Think Lower” after each incorrect guess  
- Counts number of attempts and displays it on success  
- Built using:
  - `random.randint()` for number generation  
  - `while` loop for repeated input  
  - Functions for clean separation of logic

---

### 📝 Task Manager CLI
> A simple task manager created from scratch to manage thoughts like a to-do app in the terminal.

- Asks the user how many tasks they have in mind
- Repeats the following for each task:
  - Prompts to `add`, `view`, or `remove` a task
  - `add`: Accepts custom task input and appends it to the list  
  - `view`: Prints all current tasks (line-by-line)
  - `remove`: Deletes a task by index (entered by user)
- Uses:
  - `for` loop for controlling task interaction count  
  - `list.append()` for storing tasks dynamically  
  - `del` keyword for index-based deletion  
  - `input().lower()` for case-insensitive command handling
- Includes basic invalid input handling

🧠 This project helped solidify list manipulation, loops, and conditional command execution in Python.

### 🎲 Dice Roller Simulator

A simple text-based dice rolling simulator that:
- Prompts the user to roll a die.
- Displays a number between 1–6 using Python's `random` module.
- Repeats until the user decides to stop.
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

**Technologies:** Python (beginner-friendly)

> Try it: Run `dice_simulator.py` and type `yes` or `no` to roll or quit.

### 🕒 Simple Digital Clock using Python & Tkinter

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that creates a simple digital clock using the Tkinter GUI library.

## 📌 Features
- Displays the current time in HH:MM:SS format
- Updates every second
- Simple and clean UI
- Customizable fonts and colors

### 🌡️ Celsius ↔️ Fahrenheit Converter

A light-hearted temperature converter built with Python!  
Ever wondered what Gabriel Fahrenheit or Anders Celsius might say about your room temperature?  
Well, now you can find out — with style.

## 🚀 Features

- Convert from **Celsius to Fahrenheit** or **Fahrenheit to Celsius**
- Whimsical outputs inspired by the original creators
- Friendly messages (unless you mess up 😏)

---


### 💱 Currency Converter (Python)

A simple currency converter built in Python using the `forex-python` library. It takes input from the user to convert a specified amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates.

### 🚀 Features

- Convert between any two international currencies
- Uses live exchange rates
- Clean and simple CLI interface

### BMI Calculator 🧮

This is a simple Python program that calculates your **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on your height and weight. It helps you understand whether your body weight is underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

### 📋 Categories

| BMI Range       | Category       |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Below 18.5      | Underweight    |
| 18.5 – 24.9     | Normal Weight  |
| 25 – 29.9       | Overweight     |
| 30 and above    | Obese          |
