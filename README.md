# 🐍 Python Projects by Titiksha

Welcome to my Python playground — a growing collection of real-world Python projects built to sharpen my problem-solving, logic-building, and software development skills.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
> Inspired by a FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

- Developed a terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game  
- Focused on input handling, random generation, and conditional logic  
- Solidified understanding of functions, loops, and clean user prompts  
- Reinforced the idea of **logic-first coding**

### 🧠 Seat Allotment System
> Designed and coded from scratch to simulate category-based merit seat allotment.  
> Inspired by UPTAC counselling system.

- Accepts multiple student inputs with category, marks, and gender  
- Sorts candidates by marks using nested list logic  
- Allocates open category seats first, then fills reserved seats:
  - OBC Girl
  - OBC
  - SC
  - EWS  
- Avoids duplication of selected students

### 🧮 Calculator App (CLI)
> A simple terminal-based calculator built to explore functions, loops, and user interaction in Python.

- Performs basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Validates division by zero and gives custom feedback  
- Uses `while` loop to support repeated calculations  
- Introduced functions for modular and reusable code  
- Friendly user prompts and error messages

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo documents my **Python journey** — one project at a time.  
Each file reflects my current understanding, problem-solving style, and learning goals.  
I’m not building just to showcase — I'm building to **understand, improve, and grow**.

If you're a recruiter, developer, or learner browsing through — welcome aboard.  
If you're me, reading this a few months later — keep going, you're doing great ✨
