# 🐍 Python Projects by Titiksha

Welcome to my Python playground — a growing collection of real-world Python projects built to sharpen my problem-solving, logic-building, and software development skills.

## ✅ Completed Projects

### 🎮 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
> Inspired by a FreeCodeCamp tutorial.

- Developed a terminal-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game  
- Focused on input handling, random generation, and conditional logic  
- Solidified understanding of functions, loops, and clean user prompts  
- Reinforced the idea of **logic-first coding**

### 🧠 Seat Allotment System
> Designed and coded from scratch to simulate category-based merit seat allotment.  
> Inspired by UPTAC counselling system.

- Accepts multiple student inputs with category, marks, and gender  
- Sorts candidates by marks using nested list logic  
- Allocates open category seats first, then fills reserved seats:
  - OBC Girl
  - OBC
  - SC
  - EWS  
- Avoids duplication of selected students

### 🧮 Calculator App (CLI)
> A simple terminal-based calculator built to explore functions, loops, and user interaction in Python.

- Performs basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Validates division by zero and gives custom feedback  
- Uses `while` loop to support repeated calculations  
- Introduced functions for modular and reusable code  
- Friendly user prompts and error messages

### 🔢 Number Guessing Game
> A terminal-based interactive number guessing game using randomness and loop logic.

- Randomly generates a number between 0 and 100  
- Prompts the user to guess until the correct number is entered  
- Gives hints like “Think Higher” or “Think Lower” after each incorrect guess  
- Counts number of attempts and displays it on success  
- Built using:
  - `random.randint()` for number generation  
  - `while` loop for repeated input  
  - Functions for clean separation of logic

---

### 📝 Task Manager CLI
> A simple task manager created from scratch to manage thoughts like a to-do app in the terminal.

- Asks the user how many tasks they have in mind
- Repeats the following for each task:
  - Prompts to `add`, `view`, or `remove` a task
  - `add`: Accepts custom task input and appends it to the list  
  - `view`: Prints all current tasks (line-by-line)
  - `remove`: Deletes a task by index (entered by user)
- Uses:
  - `for` loop for controlling task interaction count  
  - `list.append()` for storing tasks dynamically  
  - `del` keyword for index-based deletion  
  - `input().lower()` for case-insensitive command handling
- Includes basic invalid input handling

🧠 This project helped solidify list manipulation, loops, and conditional command execution in Python.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repo documents my **Python journey** — one project at a time.  
Each file reflects my current understanding, problem-solving style, and learning goals.  
I’m not building just to showcase — I'm building to **understand, improve, and grow**.

If you're a recruiter, developer, or learner browsing through — welcome aboard.  
If you're me, reading this a few months later — keep going, you're doing great ✨
